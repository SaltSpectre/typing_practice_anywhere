There are a input method called "composing". It's often used when there are one-to-many relationship between what you typed and what you intended to express, like when using handwriting keyboard or the Japanese language.

Typing Practice Anywhere comes with a special handling for that kind of input method. There's nothing to care, just type as you normally do, then the extension will do the job.

# Alpha Version Now
I used to type along what I want to memorize, and it was quite effective. As many of the contents I was memorizing were from the Internet, I have automated what I was doing by integrating the process into the web browser as this extension.

I'm now actively maintaining this extension to fix bugs and expand functionality. So any bug reports or feature requests are welcome. I'll appreciate any of them.
